## Summary 

Webscraping is a great tool for collecting live and current data from the internet for a project. It's also great for doing a project and needing to compile your own data that is currently not available in a CSV, R, SQL, and JSON like in most cases. This project is a simple demostration of some the script available within our available webscraping tools.
